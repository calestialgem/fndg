# Founding

An **unchained** map game where you battle for resources while _building_ your
_nation_ up.

## Features

Here "unchained" means that there will be no arbitrary limits on the quantity of
stuff like units and cities. This is the game's main aim, which spills to
_modding support_ as well. Although, the scope is very small for now.

The prototype will have the minimum amount of features: _map generation_ from
perlin noise, building and capturing _cities_, recruiting _armies_, and a simple
_enemy AI_ to play againts.

If all these can be implemented, more economy focused features will be done:
_roads_, _buildings_, _city improvements_, _sailing_. A third set of features,
which are about incresing the depth of the game, can be done as time allows.
These will be _technology_, _diplomacy_, and _multiplayer_.

## Game Engine

Using **Bevy** as the powering technology.

## Author

Keep in mind that I'm very new to **Rust** (and **Bevy**, as you can imagine)! I
programmed in **Java** for 7-8 years, then tried some **C/C++**, and ended up in
**Rust**.

I create games and programs for _hobby_, I cannot go at it full-time. I will try
to get atleast a prototype running in _2 weeks_. After that the development
_might stall_ because of the university.
